About me
--------

Hey! My name is Pierre Camilleri. 

I grew up in the Limousin, France, but I now live and work in Paris. I am
a senior data scientist currently looking for a position, striving for a 
social impact company putting people at the center of his business. I am open 
to changing my career path to find the right company.

About my data practice, I love to get my hands dirty to get the most out of 
data, big or small, and
have the same appeal for statistics and computer science. You can browse my
resume to know more about my experience. 

Outside of work, I am the of a lovely little girl. I have also been
playing the piano since I was a child and lately I decided that I wanted to
learn to play jazz and improvise. I have made considerable improvements since
then, thanks to numerous practice hours. I now need to gain confidence and I
am now looking to play with other people! I also enjoy a
game of chess or a hike in the woods.

About the blog
--------------

I love to discuss my discoveries and my ideas. However, I have never been a 
fan
of social networks. I always felt them as too intrusive in my private life,
aimed at triggering addictive behaviors, and I generally don't like to be in
the spotlight. Not to mention the shameless personal data theft performed by
many digital tech giants. 

So, writing my own blog is for me a way to share my ideas outside my direct
personal and professional sphere and to meet new people with shared interests.
It is for me also an incentive to go to the bottom of my ideas, to cleanly lay
out my experimentations, and to carve the different techniques into my memory.

What will the blog be about ? Well, it will depend on my current interests, 
probably about collective decision making and democracy, and about data 
science and modeling.

I recently discovered the "Manifesto for software craftsmanship" and its 
related
material. The manifesto puts the design and writing of computer code at the
center of software development (as opposed, for example, to methods guided by
functional or temporal requirements). I strive for this approach, to put
practice back at the center of data analysis, rather than being driven by
simplistic performance objectives. 

This blog will be my support to deliberately practice new techniques,
consolidate my knowledge and refine my vision on the practice of data science.
